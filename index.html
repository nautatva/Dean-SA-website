    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>The IIT Bombay campus provides an ideal setting for students to participate in recreational and extracurricular
      activities. IITB's a core program involving co-curricular activities for UG students in their first year is meant
      to provide them a launching pad for these activities. The mandate of the Student Affairs Office is to coordinate
      and regulate all aspects of student life at IITB. This is carried out primarily through two bodies:
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Hostels Coordinating Unit ( HCU )
        </li>
        <li> The Students Gymkhana, which has a group of highly qualified sports officers and other instructors to run
          all
          the activities. The Gymkhana also forms the hub for the cultural activities of the students.

        campus known for its natural beauty. A fully residential institute, all its students are accommodated in its 17
        hostels with in-house dining; the campus also provides excellent amenities for sports and other recreational
        facilities. Efforts are continually made to enhance the quality of student life that you are going to be part of
        very soon.
        
        I sincerely hope that along with your studies, you will actively participate in one or more activities of your
        choice which keep happening over the year. As you know, the goal is to be a well-developed personality and a
        responsible citizen as you graduate as an IITian. Your stay in a Hostel will make you a member of the Hostel.
        You
        will cherish it the most in later years when you meet a fellow IITian from your Hostel.
        
        I would also like to request you to take note of the rules and regulations that exist for all of us here at IIT
        Bombay. You know, rules & regulations are made to bring about discipline in the way one leads one's life. They

        parental assistance for the first time. You will enjoy the fresh air of freedom but some may find it difficult
